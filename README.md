# First-day-Python
Here i will start understanding the basics of python 
#my ADHD stopps me always and i have to fight it always as i can 
i'm a mess yeah but i will get there for sure 
i started today again with CS50's by harvard school and i want to learn python based on thier resources again 
well here will everything be random and i wll take all the acttions i needed o make my self better than ever before 
i started again with functions and variables and i will not leave until i get it done
i made this website as a blog for me where people write code but me i write first what i'm doing and going though this way 
First things to do now is to write codes with the course that i’m watching right now 
And it will be about Functions and variable
#this is how to use comments just by clicking on the alt+# on the keyboard 

And you can write code wherever you want like VS code “visual studio” or even other thing like text editor google docs and microsoft word the main is how format you save it for
Because that's what code is bunch of texts but saved on the right format
Parentheses is tis () you can’t write code without it and also a quote in programming or python is like this “ “ and it’s also called string is the content of the code inside the parenthesis.
Bugs is a mistake in the programme to any other language like python or java script or whatever
let's start with this 
to write a code on bython there is always 3 things to respect first is what to do like Print or input or whatever and then the () followed with "" for exemple the first code to write now is 
print("Hello, World ") that's a code.
and you telling to the computer to print to you on the screen Hello world like it is.
